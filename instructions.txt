THIS PROJECT IS PROBABLY STILL ONLINE YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT AT:

These are instructions on how to replicate my experiment.
Firstly, you need an idea of what the original experiment was like.
This can be seen on 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07597v1.pdf'
To get the site online, you need to use GitHub pages. 
'https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart'
You can copy all of my HTML and JS code. 
Some tweaking on how the files relate to and open each other may be needed to get going.
If you want to generate new test data, you can use the python code in the 
'generateminidatabase' folder. Otherwise, you can access it from my repositories directly:
'https://github.com/bananko7/HC3database' for the dataset that I used (unequally distributed though)
'https://github.com/bananko7/HC3databaseEQUAL' for a better distributed dataset
You will need to set up an EmailJS account and then set up the email functionality
in order to get the results. This can be done easily and for free on 'https://www.emailjs.com'
When you collect your data, you can evaluate it with the files in the statistics folder.
If you have any questions, contact me by email: 'oknanab7@gmail.com'
